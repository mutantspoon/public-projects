## Grid Update
zooming out is ineffective UX
when you zoom out to a certain point put a major line every 10 ft

## rendering
lines and vertecies are an absolute size, they should be a screensize, 
at the moment when i zoom into inches a vertex is like 2" wide, this keeps me from being able to work,
this is why they should be in screen size, 
same goes for text, things should always be "readable" and not be too tiny or cover too much space

## dimensions
if a line / wall / segment is fully visible put the length in the middle like it does now, but if i have say a really long line that goes off screen and the middle is off screen, clamp that dimension to the edge of the screen
